        <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>My mom has given up so much to allow my brothers and me to have the best life possible. She is someone who has a kind heart, but also protects the people she loves the most. I am grateful I see parts of her in my personality.</p>
